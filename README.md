# Git-assignment
part 1
Today I learned the basic Git commands:

git init: Initializes a new Git repository locally.

git clone <repo-url>: Copies a remote repository to your local machine.

git add <file>: Adds files to the staging area, preparing them for commit.

git commit -m "message": Commits staged changes with a descriptive message.

git push: Uploads committed changes from the local repository to the remote repository.

git status: Shows the current state of files (tracked, untracked, staged).

git log: Shows the commit history of the repository.

git remote add origin <repo-url>: Links your local repo to a remote repository for pushing.

git branch: Manages branches in the repository.

git checkout <branch>: Switches between branches.
